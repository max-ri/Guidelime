# Guidelime

A WoW Classic addon for leveling guides with automatic progress updates

## What does it do?

Guides are shown as a list of steps where the progress is updated automatically as much as possible (quests picked up / completed, quest 
items looted / mobs killed, etc). Only for some steps completion has to be confirmed manually (such as resupplying, getting new skills, etc). 
Locations referenced in the guide are shown on the map and minimap. Also there is an arrow pointing in the direction towards the next step.

It completely supports Burning Crusade Classic and Wrath of the Lich King Classic. There are guides for Draenei, Blood Elf, and Death Knight starting zones, as well as Alliance and Horde Outland and Northrend guides.

The addon comes with an editor so even if the number of guides included is small (yet) it is very easy to create your own guides or to import
your favorite guide.

*This is for WoW Classic only. It will not run on private servers and/or retail.*

## How do I install the addon?

When you download the zip file from this page (click "Clone or Download" then "Download Zip") you will find a *Guidelime* folder (inside the *Guidelime-master* folder). Copy this folder into your *Addons* folder.

By using this method you will always get to most recent version of the addon (*master*) including all changes that are being made as soon as they are published.

Alternatively you can also download the addon from https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/guidelime or install it via the CurseForge client or any other addon manager. This way you will get the latest stable release. (Which currently is also being updated in average once a day.)

## How do I install a guide?

You install a guide the same way you would install any other addon: Copy the folder containing the guide into your *Addons* folder (in the same folder where the *Guidelime* folder is in).

You can also use the CurseForge client or other addon manager to install a guide.
